However, current\nstate-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for\nprompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event\naudio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level\napplications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI\nfeedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines\nto: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio\n(Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the\nlanguage description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic\nand harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We\nevaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate\nsignificantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This\nhighlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics.\nUtilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference\ndataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each\naccompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a\nbenchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling\nscenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models.

To address these\nissues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information\nembedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical\nfeatures are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic\nfiltering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features\nof images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and\ncritical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a\ndiffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual\ninformation fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the\ngenerated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features,\nthe GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted\nfeatures and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we\ndesign a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume\nof features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental\nresults validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating\nwith both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized\nsystem achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of\nhigher PSNR and lower FID scores.", "authors": ["Jianhao Huang", "Qunsong Zeng", "Kaibin Huang"], "published_date": "2025-05-15", "title_zh": "具有關鍵資訊嵌入的生成式語義通訊視覺保真度指標", "summary_zh": "研究提出一種混合生成式語義通訊系統，透過嵌入關鍵資訊框架，同時傳輸文字提示和語義上重要的圖像特徵，以解決純粹提示驅動的生成導致細節丟失的問題。為評估系統性能，提出生成式視覺資訊保真度（GVIF）指標，以量化失真特徵與原始特徵之間的互信息。實驗結果驗證了GVIF指標對視覺保真度的敏感性，並設計了一種基於GVIF最大化的通道自適應系統，能夠根據通道狀態調整特徵數量和壓縮率，進而提升重建圖像的品質。", "audio": "audios/2505.10405v1.mp3", "timestamp": "2025-05-18T17:14:39.044337"}

While equilibria in the\none-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to\ncompute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first\nround serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the\noutcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a\npowerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated)\nequilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the\ndecision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed\nto the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game\nfollowing intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting\n[Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec\net al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in\nthe previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show\nthat every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives\nan equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than\nthe one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a\nnatural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting\nfails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority\ndecision whenever one-round voting can.
